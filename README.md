# English-Dictionary-App

MODULE USED :  

In this script, we will use the JSON module because we will use a JSON file and loading requires the JSON module.

What is JSON :

JSON (Java Script Object Notation) is an inbuilt python library which provides us various functions to read and write the file with .
JSON extension and it usually deals with the file which looks like a python dictionary.

The aim of this project is to create an English Dictionary app that returns definitions of English words. 
The words and their meanings should be stored as a dictionary in words.txt, using the concept of serialization. 


When the application is started, it displays a menu as follows:

Main Menu

1. Add a new word
2. Find the meaning
3. Update a word
4. Exit

If the user giving their choice the english dictionary app should perform the following : 

CHOICE 1 : 
If item 1 is selected, it should prompt for a word and then accept its meaning. This pair of word and its meaning should be stored in a file called ‘words.txt’. 

CHOICE 2 :
When item 2 is selected, it should prompt for a word, search that word in the file ‘words.txt’ and return the meaning if it is found. 
If the meaning is not found in the dictionary, it should displays an appropriate message.

CHOICE 3 :
Similarly, when choice 3 is entered, it should accept a word and update its meaning.

CHOICE 4 : 
If choice 4 is selected, a graceful exit should be performed.

In all the above three cases, the prompt should returns to the main menu.
